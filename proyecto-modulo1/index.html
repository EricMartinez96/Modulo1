                    <p><b>League of Legends ranks and divitions</b></p>
                        <p>Ranks in League of Legends are classifications that represent players' skill levels. 
                            They start from the lowest rank, Iron, and ascend in order through Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, 
                            Grandmaster, and Challenger, the latter being reserved for the top players. 
                            Each rank has divisions that reflect progress within that rank. 
                            Players aim to improve their skills and reach higher ranks as they play.</p>
